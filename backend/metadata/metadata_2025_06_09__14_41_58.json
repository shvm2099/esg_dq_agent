      "text": "Environmental Stewardship\nIntel reduced its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% from a 2020 baseline, primarily due to enhanced operational energy efficiency and an increase in renewable energy procurement. All emissions disclosures align with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, and emission factors are regionally adjusted.\nThe company invested $50 million in energy efficiency upgrades and committed to achieving Net-Zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040, exceeding the Paris Agreement timeline. In 2023, 65% of Intel’s global operations were powered by renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro), with plans to reach 80% by 2025.\nIntel achieved zero waste-to-landfill status at eight major sites and improved water stewardship by reducing usage by 15%, enabled by closed-loop water recycling systems. In the area of supply chain sustainability, 85% of tier-1 suppliers are now aligned with Intel’s Supplier ESG Code of Conduct. A new carbon tracking initiative for suppliers, aligned with Scope 3 emissions reporting, was rolled out in Q3 2023.\nTo address biodiversity and environmental compliance, Intel conducted Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) across its manufacturing hubs and maintained 100% compliance with local environmental regulations.",
