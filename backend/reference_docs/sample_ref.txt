Stakeholder Engagement
TechNova’s approach to stakeholder engagement is rooted in transparency,
inclusivity, and responsiveness. We recognize that our long-term success depends
on understanding and addressing the expectations of diverse stakeholder groups,
including employees, customers, investors, suppliers, regulators, communities,
and non-governmental organizations. In 2024, we conducted a comprehensive
stakeholder mapping exercise, followed by a series of engagement activities such
as online surveys, focus groups, town hall meetings, and bilateral consultations.
Over 2,000 stakeholders participated in these activities, providing valuable
feedback on our ESG performance and priorities. Key themes raised included
climate action, data privacy, diversity and inclusion, supply chain responsibility,
and ethical innovation. Stakeholder input directly informed our materiality
assessment and the development of our 2025-2027 sustainability strategy. We
also established a Stakeholder Advisory Panel, comprising representatives from
civil society, academia, and industry, to provide ongoing guidance and
independent perspectives on our ESG initiatives.
Material Topics
Following the GRI Standards, TechNova conducted a formal materiality
assessment in 2024 to identify the ESG topics most significant to our business
and stakeholders. The assessment process included internal workshops, external
stakeholder consultations, and a review of emerging trends and regulatory
developments. The following material topics were identified as priorities for
reporting and management: climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, energy
efficiency and renewable energy, responsible supply chain management,
diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), employee well-being and development,
data privacy and cybersecurity, innovation and digital inclusion, business ethics
and anti-corruption, and board oversight and accountability. Each material topic
was evaluated based on its potential impact on TechNova’s business
performance, reputation, and stakeholder trust. The results of the materiality
assessment are reviewed annually and inform our ESG strategy, risk
management, and performance measurement.
Management Approach
TechNova’s management approach to ESG is guided by our Sustainability Policy,
which is approved by the Board of Directors and implemented by the Executive
Sustainability Committee. The committee, chaired by the Chief Sustainability
Officer, includes senior leaders from operations, human resources, legal,
procurement, and risk management. ESG objectives are integrated into our
corporate strategy, business planning, and performance management systems.
Each material topic is assigned to a responsible executive, who oversees the
development and execution of action plans, monitors progress, and reports on
outcomes. We employ a risk-based approach to ESG management, incorporating
scenario analysis, stress testing, and regular audits. Our Supplier Code of
Conduct, Human Rights Policy, and Code of Business Ethics set clear
expectations for employees, suppliers, and partners. Training on ESG topics is
mandatory for all employees, with specialized programs for high-risk roles.
TechNova’s ESG performance is regularly reviewed by the Board’s
Sustainability and Ethics Committee, which meets quarterly and provides
guidance on emerging risks and opportunities.
Environmental Performance
TechNova is committed to minimizing its environmental footprint and advancing
the transition to a low-carbon economy. In 2024, our total Scope 1 and 2
greenhouse gas emissions were 410,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent,
representing a 17 percent reduction from our 2023 baseline of 494,000 metric
tons. This achievement was driven by energy efficiency measures, increased use
of renewable energy, and process optimization across our operations. Scope 3
emissions, primarily from our supply chain and product use, totaled 1.85 million
metric tons of CO2 equivalent, a 6 percent reduction year-over-year. We have set
a science-based target to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain by
2040.
Renewable energy accounted for 61 percent of our global electricity consumption
in 2024, up from 47 percent in 2023. Major facilities in the United States,
Germany, and Japan transitioned to 100 percent renewable energy through power
purchase agreements and on-site solar installations. Our energy intensity,
measured as megawatt-hours per million USD revenue, decreased by 14 percent
compared to the previous year. Water consumption across our operations was 2.8
million cubic meters, a 9 percent reduction from 2023, achieved through water
recycling and efficiency projects at our manufacturing sites. We diverted 74
percent of our operational waste from landfill, with 36,000 metric tons recycled
or reused.
TechNova’s product stewardship program focuses on designing energy-efficient
hardware, increasing the use of recycled materials, and promoting circularity. In
2024, 28 percent of materials used in our products were recycled content, and 91
percent of products met Energy Star or equivalent standards. We collected and
responsibly recycled 18,000 metric tons of end-of-life products through our
global take-back program. Environmental compliance was maintained across all
jurisdictions, with no significant fines or violations reported.
Social Performance
TechNova’s social strategy centers on fostering an inclusive, safe, and
empowering workplace, supporting local communities, and advancing digital
inclusion. As of December 2024, our global workforce comprised 72,000
employees, with 43 percent women and 29 percent from underrepresented
minorities. Women held 38 percent of management positions and 24 percent of
executive roles, reflecting an 8 percent increase in overall diversity representation
compared to 2023. Our Board of Directors included 45 percent women and 36
percent members from diverse backgrounds.
Employee well-being and development are strategic priorities. In 2024, we
invested USD 62 million in training and development, averaging 42 hours of
learning per employee. Our global employee engagement survey recorded an 83
percent participation rate, with an overall engagement score of 81 percent, up 3
percentage points from the previous year. We expanded our flexible work
policies, with 68 percent of employees utilizing hybrid or remote work
arrangements. Health and safety performance remained strong, with a total
recordable injury rate of 0.23 per 100 full-time employees, a 15 percent reduction
from 2023.
TechNova’s community engagement initiatives focused on digital literacy,
STEM education, and economic empowerment. Through the TechNova
Foundation, we supported 312 nonprofit organizations and reached 1.2 million
beneficiaries in 2024. Our Digital Inclusion Program provided access to
technology and training for 420,000 individuals in underserved communities
across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Employee volunteering totaled 138,000
hours, with 41 percent of employees participating in at least one community
service activity.
Human rights are integral to our operations and supply chain. We conducted
human rights due diligence for 97 percent of Tier 1 suppliers and provided
training on labor rights, anti-discrimination, and grievance mechanisms. No
substantiated cases of child labor, forced labor, or significant human rights
violations were identified in 2024. Our Supplier Diversity Program increased
spend with women-owned and minority-owned businesses by 21 percent year-
over-year.
Governance
TechNova’s governance framework is designed to promote ethical conduct,
accountability, and long-term value creation. The Board of Directors comprises
11 members, 45 percent of whom are women and 36 percent from diverse ethnic
backgrounds. The Board is led by an independent Chair and includes three
standing committees: Audit, Compensation, and Sustainability & Ethics. In 2024,
the Board met 11 times, with an average attendance rate of 98 percent. The
Sustainability & Ethics Committee is responsible for overseeing ESG strategy,
risk management, and performance, meeting quarterly to review progress and
provide guidance.
Executive compensation is linked to ESG performance, with 22 percent of annual
incentives tied to sustainability targets such as emissions reduction, diversity
representation, and data privacy. The company’s Code of Business Ethics sets out
clear expectations for integrity, anti-corruption, and compliance, and is reviewed
annually. In 2024, 100 percent of employees and 96 percent of suppliers
completed mandatory ethics training. Our whistleblower hotline received 138
reports, all of which were investigated, resulting in 17 cases of disciplinary action
and 4 terminations for breaches of policy.
Data privacy and cybersecurity are top priorities for TechNova. In 2024, we
invested USD 136 million in cybersecurity infrastructure and achieved ISO/IEC
27001 certification for all major data centers. We experienced no material data
breaches and maintained compliance with global data protection regulations,
including GDPR and CCPA. Our Privacy by Design framework ensures that data
protection is embedded in all products and services.
Risk management is integrated into our governance processes, with regular
scenario analysis and stress testing for ESG-related risks such as climate change,
supply chain disruptions, and regulatory changes. The company’s internal audit
function conducted 27 ESG-related audits in 2024, with findings reported to the
Board and management.
Conclusions and Future Outlook
In 2024, TechNova International made significant progress in advancing its ESG
agenda, achieving measurable improvements in environmental performance,
workforce diversity, employee well-being, and governance practices. Our
achievements reflect the dedication of our employees, the support of our
stakeholders, and the leadership of our Board and management team. However,
we recognize that challenges remain, particularly in reducing Scope 3 emissions,
advancing supply chain sustainability, and addressing the evolving risks
associated with digital transformation.
Looking ahead, TechNova is committed to accelerating its journey towards net-
zero emissions, with interim targets of 75 percent renewable energy use and a 30
percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2030. We will expand our circular
economy initiatives, increase the use of recycled materials in our products, and
scale up our take-back and recycling programs. Our social priorities include
deepening our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, enhancing
employee well-being, and expanding digital inclusion efforts to reach 2 million
beneficiaries by 2027.
Governance will remain a cornerstone of our ESG strategy, with continued focus
on board diversity, ethical conduct, and robust risk management. We will enhance
transparency through expanded ESG disclosures, third-party assurance, and
ongoing stakeholder engagement. TechNova will continue to align its
sustainability strategy with global frameworks such as the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures, and the Science Based Targets initiative.
We thank our stakeholders for their trust and partnership, and we look forward to
working together to create a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future. This
report reflects our ongoing commitment to responsible business practices and our
belief that technology can be a force for good in society and the environment.
